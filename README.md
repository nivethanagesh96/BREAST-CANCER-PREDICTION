# BREAST-CANCER-PREDICTION
Cancer prediction on Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset using supervised learning-Logistic Regression. The model have achieved 94% of accuracy.

This project implements Logistic Regression to classify breast cancer as malignant[0] or benign[1] using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset. 

The model is trained on 80% of the data and tested on 20%. Performance evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report shows high prediction accuracy, demonstrating the effectiveness of logistic regression for medical diagnosis tasks.
